         <p class="p Runin List1">(a)(i) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply restrictions of the Buy American Act to Canadian end products with estimated values of $25,000 or less as defined in 1825.003–70. Accordingly, contracting officers must evaluate all offers for such Canadian end products on a parity with offers for domestic end products, except that applicable duty (whether or not a duty free entry certificate may be issued) must be included in evaluating offers for Canadian end products.

         <p class="p List2">(ii) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that for procurements subject to the Trade Agreements Act, it would be inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American Act to U.S.-made end products that are substantially transformed in the United States.
