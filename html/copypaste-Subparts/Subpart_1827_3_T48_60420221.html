         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Introduction.</em> NASA policy with respect to any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation made in the performance of work under any NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and the allocation of related property rights is based upon Section 20135 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135) (the Act); and, to the extent consistent with this statute, the Presidential Memorandum on Government Patent Policy to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated February 18, 1983, and Section 1(b)(4) of Executive Order 12591. NASA contractors subject to Section 20135 of the Act shall ensure the prompt reporting of reportable items in order to protect the Government's interest and to provide the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination, early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability for the benefit of the scientific, industrial, and commercial communities and the general public.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Contractor right to elect title.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			For NASA contracts, the contractor right to elect title under the FAR only applies to contracts with small businesses and nonprofit organizations. For other business entities, see paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section;
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(2)(v) Under any NASA contract with other than a small business or nonprofit organization (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> contracts subject to section 20135(b) of the Act), title to subject inventions vests in NASA when the determinations of section 20135(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) have been made. The Administrator may grant the contractor a waiver of title in accordance with 14 CFR part 1245.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Contractor petitions for waiver of title.</em> The Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made in the performance of NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served. The procedures and instructions for contractors to submit petitions for waiver of rights in subject inventions are provided in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, <em class="ph i">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title14-vol5/pdf/CFR-2012-title14-vol5-part1245.pdf.</em> Waiver may be requested in advance of contract award for any subject invention or class of subject inventions or during contract performance for individually identified subject inventions reported under the contract. For individual identified subject inventions, the petition shall identify each invention with particularity (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> by NASA's assigned number to the Disclosure of Invention and New Technology report or by title and inventorship). For advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention or class of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver is being requested. To meet the statutory standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” the petition must be directed to a single invention or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly-drawn, focused area of technology. When a waiver of title is granted, the contractor's right to title, the rights reserved by the Government, and other conditions and obligations of the waiver, such as requirements for reporting and filing patent applications on waived inventions, are provided in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Government license.</em> For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, the Administrator shall reserve an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign Government in accordance with any treaty or agreement of the United States.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Utilization reports.</em> For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, the requirements for utilization reports shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">March-in rights.</em> For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, march-in rights shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Preference for United States industry.</em> For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, waiver of the requirement for substantial manufacture in the United States shall be in accordance with Title 35 of the United States Code, section 204.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			<em class="ph i">Minimum rights to contractor.</em> (1) For NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization, where title to any subject inventions vests in NASA, the contractor is normally granted, in accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR 1245.108, a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country and in any resulting patent. The license extends to any of the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure, and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right are transferable only with the approval of the Administrator, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(2) The procedures for revoking or modifying the license to a contractor that is other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization are described in 14 CFR 1245.108.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(k) <em class="ph i">Awards.</em> It is the policy of NASA to consider for a monetary award, when referred to the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board in accordance with 14 CFR part 1240, subpart 1, any subject invention reported to NASA in accordance with this subpart, and for which an application for patent has been filed.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.227–71, Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions, in all solicitations that include the clause at 1852.227–70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section).
