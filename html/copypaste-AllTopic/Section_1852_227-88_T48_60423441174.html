Before release of the GFCS, and any modified or enhanced versions thereof, to such subcontractors (at any tier), the Contractor shall insert, or require the insertion of, this clause, including this paragraph (c)(4), suitably modified to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The Government provides the GFCS in an “AS–IS” condition. The Government makes no warranty with respect to the serviceability and/or suitability of the GFCS for contract performance.

                                 <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Waiver of Claims and Indemnification.</em> The Contractor agrees to waive any and all claims against the Government and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, including attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the GFCS and related technical data by the Contractor, a subcontractor, or by any person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such GFCS or related technical data.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Flow-down of Waiver of Claims and Indemnification.</em> In the event a contract includes this NASA FAR Supplement clause 1852.227–88, the Contractor shall include the foregoing clause 1852.227–88(g), suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, which involve use of the GFCS and/or related technical data in any way. At all tiers, the clause shall be modified to define GFCS as it is defined herein and to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. In subcontracts, at any tier, the Government, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause 1852.227–88 constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Government with respect to the matters covered by the clause.</p>
