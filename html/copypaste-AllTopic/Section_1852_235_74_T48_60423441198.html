                                 <p class="p P">In addition to the final report required under this contract, the Contractor shall submit the following report(s) to the Contracting Officer: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Monthly progress reports.</em> The Contractor shall submit separate monthly reports of all work accomplished during each month of contract performance. Reports shall be in narrative form, brief, and informal. They shall include a quantitative description of progress, an indication of any current problems that may impede performance, proposed corrective action, and a discussion of the work to be performed during the next monthly reporting period. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Quarterly progress reports.</em> The Contractor shall submit separate quarterly reports of all work accomplished during each three-month period of contract performance. In addition to factual data, these reports should include a separate analysis section interpreting the results obtained, recommending further action, and relating occurrences to the ultimate objectives of the contract. Sufficient diagrams, sketches, curves, photographs, and drawings should be included to convey the intended meaning.

The final report shall be submitted within ____ days after the completion of the effort under the contract.</p>
