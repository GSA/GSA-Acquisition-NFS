</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Safety and Health Measures and Mishap Reporting (DEC 2015)

                                 <p class="p List1">(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA's safety priority is to protect: 
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The public, (2) astronauts and pilots, (3) the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), and (4) high-value equipment and property.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) The Contractor shall take all reasonable safety and occupational health measures in performing this contract. The Contractor shall maintain an effective worksite safety and health program with organized and systematic methods to—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Comply with Federal, State, and local safety and occupational health laws and with the safety and occupational health requirements of this contract;

                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Describe and assign the responsibilities of managers, supervisors, and employees;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Inspect regularly for and identify, evaluate, prevent, and control hazards;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Orient and train employees to eliminate or avoid hazards; and

                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The Contractor shall take, or cause to be taken, any other safety, and occupational health-measures the Contracting Officer may reasonably direct. To the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for those measures under the terms and conditions of this contract, the equitable adjustment shall be determined pursuant to the procedures of the changes clause of this contract; provided, that no adjustment shall be made under this Safety and Health clause for any change for which an equitable adjustment is expressly provided under any other clause of the contract.

The Contractor shall promptly take corrective action.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) If the Contractor fails or refuses to institute prompt corrective action in accordance with subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may—

                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Record the Contractor's failure to comply in the appropriate databases of past performance; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Consider the Contractor's failure to comply in any responsibility determination or evaluation of past performance.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g) in all subcontracts above the simplified acquisition threshold when the work will be conducted completely or partly on federally-controlled facilities.</p>
